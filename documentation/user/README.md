# __Internet of Things Smart Tarp: User Edition__

### Greetings

Thank you for taking time to read about this Internet of Things project! I am
excited to have you be a part of this project, even though you're probably just on the
other side of a computer screen.

### A Summary of My Project

This project is a prototype for a Smart-Tarp. You may know about many smart devices out in the world today (like watches, homes, etc.). This falls in line with those! This prototype essentially seeks to preview what an industry-level version might look like. As you may know, tarps are used to cover things; they aren't all too glamorous. This prototype arms tarps with the ability to monitor the surrounding the environment (more specifically identifying elements of temperature, humidity, and pressure).

### "What do I need to know to get started?"

Controlling the UI (or User Interface) is all you need to learn. Additionally, you will have to learn how to best take care of the hardware, as this prototype needs maintenance and upkeep. Here are some notes you might need as you navigate this project:

1. Navigate between pages using BUTTONS
2. There are a few pages you should know about: the "home" page or control panel, the user profile, and the settings page. There is also an loading screen and a login screen but these are for aesthetics only.

### "What are some specific features I should know about?"

There are two main components to this project, listed below:

1. Hardware - this is what you see in front of you!
2. Code - this is what you don't have to see!
